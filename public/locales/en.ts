  about_page_description_p1: `My name is <strong>Nadilson</strong>. I'm a software developer and a
  Historian and at the moment, in addition to be looking for a new job,
  I've been investing my free time to &quot;play&quot; with
  several technologies and <em>frameworks</em>, but without forgetting to read
  my books and articles related to the two areas to which I belong.
  I'm also into playing the electric guitar. So much so that I have three, each
  one with a different tuning to play Extreme Metal (<em>Drop C, Drop D</em> and <em>Drop C#</em>).`,

  about_page_description_p2: `This website is not my first serious project with
  <strong className="italic">Next.js</strong>, but it is the first to
  use the <em>framework</em>
  <strong className="italic">Tailwind CSS</strong> and therefore
  will be part of my continued learning about these technologies.
  So this website, which is now under construction, will always be
  modified and improved as more experience is gained.`,

  about_page_description_p3: `Thank you very much for visiting this project of mine, whose source code
  can be obtained from my repository on <em>Github</em>, and
  be sure to visit my space on <em>LinkedIn</em> and
