A few days ago, I was following the event [Iniciativa DevOps](https://iniciativadevops.com.br/), promoted by KubeDev and taught by [Fabricio Veronez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabricioveronez) , from [Formação DevOps Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devopspro/). The event, according to the description on the official website, was "an immersion of content with the aim of showing the developer a practical method to stand out in the market as a DevOps specialist and conquer one of the most desired and well-paid profiles". Nothing more true. Currently, DevOps is on the rise and there is no shortage of jobs.

**What was presented and taught at the event:**

1. What is DevOps and how it works;
2. Opportunities that revolve around Devops;
3. What they are and how to work with containers;
4. How to use Docker and Kubernetes;
5. Automate processes using CI/CD pipelines;
6. How to gain agility and simplicity in projects with Terraform;
7. Monitor your application in a practical and simple way with a visualization dashboard (Grafana and Prometheus);
8. Devops specialist training trail.

During the event, challenges were proposed at the end of each class. Each challenge delivered guaranteed the right to receive a badge. I received the badges of the 5 proposed challenges.

**But, what is DevOps?**

According to Amazon Web Services (AWS), DevOps "is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that enhance a company's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity, optimizing and improving products at a faster pace than companies that use traditional software development and infrastructure management processes". That speed, it says, "allows companies to serve their customers better and compete more effectively in the marketplace." There is more and more detailed information on the subject at the following address: [DevOps Model Defined](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/).

As I've been saying, many free online events are taking place monthly to promote professional courses or training Full Stack/DevOps developers. I also repeat that they are a good opportunity to see what technologies companies are currently expecting their candidates to know, in addition to being a great opportunity to network and, of course, expand their own knowledge. It always occurs to offer discounts and other advantages for those interested. Therefore, keep an eye on these current events and courses so as not to be left behind in the job market.
