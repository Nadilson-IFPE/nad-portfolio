My current number of followers on Github is increasing more and more and this makes me encouraged to continue studying and programming. Several of these people asked me for permission to use some of my code in both their personal and commercial projects and many added me on LinkedIn.

I have also received proposals from foreign companies after recruiters got in touch and stated that they evaluated me based on my performance on Github and the source codes that caught their attention there. This makes a big difference and encourages me to continue with the activities!

I just don't know how to explain properly why I'm still unemployed since the end of the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but I believe that my age is the reason, considering that this is extremely obvious in Brazil, a country that doesn't value anyone who has passed the age of 40 years. But, I won't give up and I will continue studying and programming until victory.
