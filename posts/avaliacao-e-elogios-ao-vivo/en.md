During the free online event on Microservices promoted by **EBAC - Escola Britânica de Artes Criativas e Tecnologia (EBAC - British School of Creative Arts and Technology)**, the instructor **Guilherme Dalleprane** - by the way, owner of an excellent didactics - launched a challenge for those who were honoring the three class days. The next day, he made a live correction of the challenges that were delivered properly resolved. I was surprised when it was my turn. You can watch the video below. You can watch it in full screen.

In times of the COVID-19 pandemic, many free online events are taking place monthly to promote professional courses or training Full Stack/DevOps developers. It's a good opportunity to see what technologies companies are currently expecting from their candidates. In addition, it is also a great opportunity to network and, of course, expand your own knowledge. At the end of each event, discounts and other advantages are offered to those interested. One tip I give is to keep an eye on these events. I'm serious: they are so worth it.
